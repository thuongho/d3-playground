Explain the decisions you made and why. More text here is better.
The way I designed the components
- d3 is used to do all the data manipulation and calculates the attributes
- React is used for DOM manipulation
- This way we are always in control of rendering the components for optimization
- Later on if there are a lot of calculations, to prevent d3 from recalculating on every render, we can use useEffect to tell focus on when to re-render and also useMemo to cache the results if nothing has changed.
- This way the components are more flexible and we can reuse them
